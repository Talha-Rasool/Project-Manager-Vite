React Project Manager (Vite + React + Tailwind CSS):

Developed a project management app using Vite and React.js. Key aspects I practiced in
this projectinclude useState, useRef, Portals, and Props.
In this application, you can manage your daily projects and tasks. Experimented with "Tailwind CSS" for
the first time to create a visually appealing and efficient web application.
